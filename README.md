# ProjectMonkey
My experiment in AI or in machine learning. Or may be none of them.
Project Monkey is a work in which I'm trying to teach virtual "monkeys" perform some social and psychological experiments.

In the first version my virtual monkey can learn that it can get some food which God gives it for some abstract work it does.
You play God and you can decide how you'll response on monkey actions. You can beat it for sleeping or feed it for work.
Or even just to beat. This is your choise.
You are the God of the monkey, do whatever you want.
